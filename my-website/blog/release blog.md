## V3.2.3.0 2024/07/01

- Version: MaxOpticsStudioSetup-3.2.3.0-windows-amd64+build.0701
- Update time: 2024/07/01

- content:

  - Optimize click `Run` to pop up a `Resource` pop-up window
  - Optimize expression validation logic
  - Optimize the logic of renaming global variables
  - Optimize progress bar display
  - Optimize some function prompt information
  - The default value of `FDTD` adapts according to the size of the structure
  - `Ruler`Unit Scale Value Range`[0.001,1000]`
  - `Farfield/Overlap`does not require the operation of `Solver` and can be run directly
  - Optimize the error messages for common errors in `DDM`
  - Import doping supports file formats such a `.txt/.dat`
  - The `Charge Monitor` and other results in `SDK` support the `Save As` function, which enables the solution of charge carriers and the import of the complete process of model solving in one script
  - Improve the display logic of non input parameter values at the interface of electrical materials

- New features added

  - Right click on `Version` to add `Delete results only` function
  - Object Tree supports right-click `Delete`
  - Add `Apply in All Directions` to `FDE/FDTD/EME Boundary Conditions`
  - After clicking `Run` on the `Ribbon` menu, a `Stop` function has been added
  - Add Animate verification to Sweet
  - Add Boundary Conditions setting to View Option
  - Object Tree adds `Copy` and `Paste`
  - New GUI interface `TFLN/APD` simulation cases
  - Add `TFLN/APD` simulation support and case studies in SDK
  - Add `Doping Monitor` and support `Doping Monitor`


- Correction

  - Fix the issue of preventing pop-up windows from closing when running tasks such as `FDE/Overlap`
  - Fix the issue where `Global Options` do not support global variables
  - Fix invalid settings for `Tolerance Relax`, `Relative Tolerance`, and `Divergence Factor` parameters in `DDM`.

- Remaining defects

  - Occasional engineering errors using `undo/redo`
  - `EME Index Monitor` does not support `Y normal/Z normal`
  - When the installation path is too deep or the project file name is too long, simulation failure may occur due to the `Windows` longest path (260 characters) limit.
  - Structures made of the same material have different colors from a `CAD` perspective
  - The `Mesh grid` display of `Monitor` is not aligned with the mode field
  - Global variables do not support uppercase letters and underscores
  - Occasional result file opening failure
  - `SDK show 3D` occasional error
  - The `SDK Structure` setting does not verify whether the tilt angle is self crossing, and opening it in GUI will result in an error
  - Occasional simulation progress shows 100% stuck, and the project needs to be manually stopped and restarted
  - `EME Profile Monitor` result error
  - The mode field `csv` coordinates generated by `SDK` are offset by half of the grid
  - Not supporting the `Windows 11` professional workstation version
  - SDK does not support extracting the results of `Doping Monitor` after simulation ends
  - When importing a larger modex file from Data Space and switching to CAD, it may cause CAD to become blank
  - The `Preview` in `Transform` occasionally doesn't work
  - Part of the `CAD` display shows too many decimal places
  - `EME Sweep` occasionally failed to initiate a task and needs to be rerun
